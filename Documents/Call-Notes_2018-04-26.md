### Call Notes from April 26

Participants - Mavis, Rachel, Ambereen, Josh, Aaron

- Problem - how best to organize weekly collected data (outside of DATIM) for analysis
- Partners report data on a weekly basis in to their partner specific Google Sheet
- Each Partner's Google Sheet has 10 tabs, one for each indicator
- Each tab is setup wide with each weekly period as it's own column
- Every week, this data needs to be processes (pulled from Google Sheets & transformed & merged) and then analyzed (currently in Excel, but preferably in Tableau)
- In an ideal world, want data to be connected directly to Tableau (not possible due to CIO restrictions and sheet structure)
- Asking for assistance around systemtizing pulls/transforming/merging data and setup visualizations in Tableau
- Not currently going down the route of collecting directly from partners' systems due to lack of partner system automation and accountability/real time tracking
- Next steps
  - Josh/Aaron to check with CIO to see if Google Sheets can be accessed by Tableau/R
  - Josh build initial R script to munge data; Josh and Aaron to continue
  - Josh and Aaron to think about alternate means of data collection
  - Mavis to send Excel visualizations
  - Call in 2 weeks
